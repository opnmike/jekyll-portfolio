  <p><strong>Timebox</strong> allows users to send encrypted packages (in the form of photos, videos, and text) to one another. The contents of these cannot be accessed the sender-defined amount of time passes.</p>
  <p>I designed and built several iterations of both the user interface and backend code. After many versions and tests, I settled on Elixir for the backend due to the ease it allowed me to build out the real-time features that were required for the app to be properly engaging.</p>
  <p>Timebox is due to release in June 2017.</p>
